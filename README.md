## Suicide Risk Analysis Using Economic Indicators & Google Trends

### Objective
Analyze whether economic indicators and online search behavior can explain and predict trends in U.S. suicide mortality.

### Data Sources
- CDC suicide mortality data (2018–2023)
- Google Trends search interest data
- U.S. economic indicators (unemployment, CPI, etc.)

### Methods
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation analysis
- Regression and tree-based models
- Feature importance and interpretability analysis

### Key Findings
- Models explained ~75% of variance in suicide counts
- Economic indicators showed stronger predictive power than search trends
- Digital behavioral signals added context but had ethical and methodological limitations

### Tools
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
