## Suicide Risk Analysis Using Economic Indicators & Google Trends

### Objective
To analyze whether U.S. economic indicators and online search behavior
can explain and predict trends in suicide mortality between 2018–2023.

### Data Sources
- CDC suicide mortality data
- Google Trends search interest data
- U.S. economic indicators (unemployment rate, CPI, etc.)

### Methods
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation analysis
- Regression and tree-based models
- Feature importance and interpretability analysis

### Key Findings
- Models explained approximately 75% of variance in suicide counts
- Economic indicators showed stronger predictive power than search trends
- Google Trends variables added contextual signals but had methodological
  and ethical limitations

### Tools
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
